# Alternatives
Windows 10 includes an underlying “Windows Subsystem for Linux” to run Linux applications.  If you are using windows 10 there is an option to run a linux bash shell that runs directly from command-line. 

This can be installed / activated as described in this blog https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/ . This can be accessed via the bash shell; however, using the ```bash -c``` you can run Linux applications without first launching a Bash window. 

Commands are then called by running the following

```
bash -c "command"
```

Note that this required the command to be contained within quotation marks. Therefore, to run in STATA you would write

```
!bash -c "command"
```

If you need literal quotes within the command you can backslash escape them

```
$ echo "Here is a \"quoted string\""
Here is a "quoted string"
```

However if you are trying to prevent word splitting of the variable, the outer quotes are usually sufficient I think

```
$ var="quoted string"; echo "Here is a $var"
Here is a quoted string
```
